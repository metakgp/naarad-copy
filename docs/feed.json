The saga of waking up just 5 minutes before class is an everlasting one with consequences that might lead to cycle collisions thanks to some of the new changes in rules around here. But for what it's worth, the IIT tag looms large before you and you might as well put these things at the back of your mind. <br> But there are some things we do look forward to. Scaling the peak of the most coveted institute in the world, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is everybody's dream. Getting admission into MIT is an objectively quantified pinnacle of achievement.  <br>  <br> Well, that explains the rat race we were put into from a very young age, right? It means that we, with our degrees and achievements, are the ones who are capable of following this road.  <br> Or does it? <br>  <br> Here is a story that will shatter such narrow conceptions and hopefully rekindle the fire for 'learning' within you. The most important thing in one's life is to question everything and set upon a journey to find the answers.
